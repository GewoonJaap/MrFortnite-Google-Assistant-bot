Mr. Fortnite Node.JS backend
=================

How to setup?
------------


At the beginning you need to change the values in the .env file, this is a protected file which contains most of the secret API keys for the 3th party websites.

Go to [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/), create a new hello-express project.
Once you are in the editor, click on the project name in the right upper corner, advanced options, import from github.
Insert this into the pop-up: **GewoonJaap/MrFortnite-Google-Assistant-bot**




How to host?
------------


I used [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) to host this the backend, Glitch is free and easy to use. There are zero costs included, and it's very user friendly!

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
