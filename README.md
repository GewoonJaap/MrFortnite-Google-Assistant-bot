Mr. Fortnite Node.JS backend
=================

How to setup?
------------


At the beginning you need to change the values in the .env file, this is a protected file which contains most of the secret API keys for the 3th party websites.

Go to [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/), create a new hello-express project.
Once you are in the editor, click on the project name in the right upper corner, advanced options, import from github.
Insert this into the pop-up: **GewoonJaap/MrFortnite-Google-Assistant-bot**




How to host?
------------


I used [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) to host this backend, Glitch is free and easy to use. There are zero costs included, and it's very user friendly!
